==============================================

NOTE: If you're looking at the plain text version of this file, you may notice a few strange characters
or punctiation in the text. These allow automatic generation of a formatted HTML version. The engine used
for this (http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/index.html[asciidoc]) allows to do that with the least impact
on readability in plain text. In short, just ignore the strange stuff :)


Introduction
------------

This package contains RelaxNG-Schemata for all relevant xml formats and a xml catalog file that maps the
namespaces to them. You can cuse these with xml editors supporting RelaxNG to allow validation and/or
code completion. There are also some support files for a specific editor (Komodo Edit), which are
explained in their own readme.

IMPORTANT: *The files included here are neither necessary for the importer or ovlmake to work, nor are
they used by them in any way!* They only help you write proper xml files if your editor supports it.


Installation
------------

Depends on your editor. Usually you'll need to put them somewhere and tell your editor where they are.
Information regaring Komodo Edit can be found in the respective readme.
